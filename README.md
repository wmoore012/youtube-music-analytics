## üé§ Channel Management & Configuration

### üì∫ Adding Artist Channels to .env

The platform supports two types of YouTube channels for comprehensive music analytics:

#### üéµ Main Artist Channels (User Content)
These are the artist's primary channels with vlogs, behind-the-scenes, and user-uploaded content:
```bash
# Format: YT_ARTISTNAME_YT=URL_or_Channel_ID
YT_BICFIZZLE_YT=https://youtube.com/@BicFizzle
YT_YOURARTIST_YT=https://www.youtube.com/@YourArtist
```

#### üè∑Ô∏è YouTube Topic Channels (Official Releases)
These auto-generated channels contain official music releases distributed through record labels:
```bash
# Format: YT_ARTISTNAME_TOPIC_YT=Channel_ID
YT_BICFIZZLE_TOPIC_YT=UC-9-kyTW8ZkZNDHQJ6FgpwQ
YT_YOURARTIST_TOPIC_YT=UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### üí° Pro Tips for Channel Configuration

#### ‚úÖ Use Channel IDs Instead of URLs
**Recommended**: `YT_ARTIST_YT=UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
**Avoid**: `YT_ARTIST_YT=https://youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Why Channel IDs are better:**
- **Faster API calls**: Direct channel ID lookup vs URL resolution
- **More reliable**: URLs can change, Channel IDs are permanent
- **Better error handling**: Clearer error messages when channels don't exist
- **Reduced API quota usage**: Saves ~20% on YouTube API calls

#### üîç How to Find Channel IDs
1. **From Channel URL**: Visit channel ‚Üí View Page Source ‚Üí Search for `"channelId"`
2. **From Video URL**: Use any video ‚Üí Channel ID is in the API response
3. **Browser Extension**: Install "YouTube Channel ID" extension
4. **API Tool**: Use YouTube's Channel List API with `forUsername` parameter

#### üéØ Topic Channel Discovery
YouTube Topic channels are auto-generated for artists with official releases:
- **Format**: Usually starts with `UC` followed by 22 characters
- **Content**: Official music videos, albums, singles from distributors
- **Finding them**: Search "Artist Name - Topic" on YouTube
- **Verification**: Topic channels have a "üéµ" icon and "Auto-generated by YouTube" text

### üßπ Data Cleanup & Quality Control

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Raw Data Cleanup Required
If unwanted content gets into your database, you **must** clean it from ALL tables:

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS run dry-run first to see what will be deleted
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --dry-run

# 2. Review the output carefully, then confirm deletion
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 3. Verify cleanup was successful
python execute_data_quality.py
```

#### üóÑÔ∏è Tables That Need Cleanup
When removing unwanted channels, data must be deleted from:
- `youtube_videos_raw` (Raw API responses)
- `youtube_videos` (Processed video data)
- `youtube_metrics` (View counts, engagement data)
- `youtube_comments` (Comment data)
- `youtube_sentiment_summary` (Sentiment analysis results)

#### üö® Critical Cleanup Rules
1. **Never delete data manually** - Always use the cleanup scripts
2. **Always run --dry-run first** - Preview changes before executing
3. **Backup before major cleanups** - Use `mysqldump` for safety
4. **Check data quality after cleanup** - Run quality checks to verify results
5. **Update .env immediately** - Remove unwanted channels from configuration

### üîß Channel Management Commands

```bash
# View current channels in database
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --status

# Preview what would be cleaned (safe to run)
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --dry-run

# Execute cleanup (removes data permanently)
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# Check data quality after changes
python execute_data_quality.py

# Validate channel configuration
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py --validate-channels
```

### üîç Channel ID Finder Utility

Use the built-in utility to find Channel IDs easily:

```bash
# Find channel by @handle
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "@BicFizzle"

# Search for Topic channels
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "BiC Fizzle - Topic"

# Validate existing Channel ID
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "UC-9-kyTW8ZkZNDHQJ6FgpwQ"

# Search by artist name
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "Corook"
```

### üìä Channel Performance Monitoring

After adding new channels, monitor their integration:

```bash
# Check if new channels are being processed
python execute_music_analytics.py | grep "Artists:"

# Verify data quality scores
python execute_data_quality.py | grep "OVERALL DATA QUALITY SCORE"

# Monitor for unexpected content
python tools/monitoring/sentiment_monitoring.py
```

### üéØ Common Topic Channel Patterns

Most major artists have auto-generated Topic channels. Here are some examples:

| Artist Type | Main Channel Format | Topic Channel Format |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Independent Artist** | `@ArtistName` | `Artist Name - Topic` |
| **Label Artist** | `@ArtistName` | `Artist Name - Topic` |
| **Band/Group** | `@BandName` | `Band Name - Topic` |
| **Producer** | `@ProducerName` | `Producer Name - Topic` |

**Topic Channel Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated by YouTube when music is distributed
- ‚úÖ Contains official releases from streaming platforms
- ‚úÖ Usually has higher view counts for popular songs
- ‚úÖ Includes music videos, audio tracks, and album releases
- ‚ùå No user-uploaded content (vlogs, behind-the-scenes)
- ‚ùå No custom thumbnails or channel art

## üö® Data Cleanup & Troubleshooting

### Common Cleanup Scenarios

#### üóëÔ∏è Removing Unwanted Artists/Channels
If you accidentally added the wrong channel or want to remove an artist:

```bash
# 1. Remove from .env file first
# Edit .env and delete or comment out the unwanted YT_ARTIST_YT lines

# 2. Preview what will be deleted (ALWAYS run this first!)
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --dry-run

# 3. Review the output carefully - it shows exactly what will be deleted

# 4. If everything looks correct, execute the cleanup
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 5. Verify the cleanup worked
python execute_data_quality.py
```

#### üîÑ Replacing a Channel ID
If you need to update a channel ID (wrong channel, artist changed handles, etc.):

```bash
# 1. Update the channel ID in .env
# Change: YT_ARTIST_YT=old_channel_id
# To:     YT_ARTIST_YT=new_channel_id

# 2. Clean out old data
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 3. Run ETL to collect new data
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py

# 4. Verify new data is correct
python execute_music_analytics.py
```

#### üßπ Full Database Reset
If you want to start completely fresh:

```bash
# 1. Backup your .env configuration
cp .env .env.backup

# 2. Clear all artist channels from .env temporarily
# Comment out all YT_*_YT lines

# 3. Run cleanup to remove all data
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 4. Restore your .env and run ETL
cp .env.backup .env
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py
```

### üö® Critical Data Cleanup Rules

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Any Cleanup Operation
1. **Backup your database**: `mysqldump yt_proj > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql`
2. **Review .env configuration**: Ensure only desired artists are listed
3. **Run dry-run first**: Always use `--dry-run` to preview changes
4. **Check data quality**: Run quality checks after cleanup

#### üóÑÔ∏è Tables Affected by Cleanup
When removing artists, data is deleted from ALL these tables:
- `youtube_videos_raw` - Raw API responses
- `youtube_videos` - Processed video metadata
- `youtube_metrics` - View counts and engagement data
- `youtube_comments` - Comment text and metadata
- `youtube_sentiment_summary` - Sentiment analysis results
- `youtube_etl_runs` - ETL execution logs

#### üîç Verification Commands
After any cleanup operation, run these to verify success:

```bash
# Check artist count matches .env configuration
python execute_music_analytics.py | head -10

# Verify data quality score (should be >95%)
python execute_data_quality.py | grep "OVERALL DATA QUALITY SCORE"

# Check for any unexpected channels
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --status

# Verify normalized tables are updated
ls -la music_analysis_tables/
```

### üÜò Emergency Recovery

#### If Cleanup Deleted Too Much Data
```bash
# 1. Stop all ETL processes immediately
pkill -f "python.*etl"

# 2. Restore from backup (if you made one)
mysql yt_proj < backup_YYYYMMDD.sql

# 3. If no backup, re-run ETL (will take time to rebuild)
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py

# 4. Update .env to prevent future issues
# Review and fix channel configuration
```

#### If Wrong Artist Data Appears
```bash
# 1. Identify the problematic channel
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --status

# 2. Check .env for typos or wrong channel IDs
grep "YT_.*_YT" .env

# 3. Use channel finder to verify correct IDs
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "@suspected_wrong_handle"

# 4. Fix .env and clean up
# Edit .env with correct channel ID
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm
```

### üí° Pro Tips for Clean Data

1. **Use Channel IDs, not URLs**: More reliable and faster
2. **Verify channels before adding**: Use the channel finder utility
3. **Start small**: Add one artist at a time to test
4. **Monitor data quality**: Run quality checks after each change
5. **Keep backups**: Database dumps before major changes
6. **Document changes**: Keep notes on why channels were added/removed

## üöÄ Quality Assurance & CI/CD

### üîí Pre-Commit Validation

Set up automatic quality checks that run before every commit:

```bash
# Install git hooks (one-time setup)
python scripts/setup_git_hooks.py

# Now every commit will automatically validate:
# ‚úÖ Notebook syntax and structure
# ‚úÖ Artist data consistency
# ‚úÖ Import statements work
# ‚úÖ Execute scripts run successfully
# ‚úÖ All tests pass
```

### üé§ Artist Data Validation

Ensure all configured artists appear in your data:

```bash
# Validate artist consistency
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py

# Update config from current .env (when adding/removing artists)
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py --update-config

# Validate only notebook outputs
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py --notebooks-only
```

### üîß Local CI/CD Pipeline

Run comprehensive quality checks before pushing:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
python scripts/run_local_ci.py

# Auto-fix issues where possible
python scripts/run_local_ci.py --fix-issues

# This validates:
# ‚úÖ No duplicate notebooks
# ‚úÖ Valid JSON syntax in all notebooks
# ‚úÖ All imports work correctly
# ‚úÖ Execute scripts have valid syntax
# ‚úÖ Notebooks execute successfully
# ‚úÖ Data consistency checks pass
# ‚úÖ Artist data matches configuration
# ‚úÖ All tests pass
```

### üìä Artist Configuration Management

The system uses two sources for artist validation:

#### üè† Local Development (uses .env)
- Reads artist configuration from your `.env` file
- Automatically detects both main and Topic channels
- Perfect for local development and testing

#### üè≠ CI/CD Pipeline (uses config/expected_artists.json)
- Uses committed configuration file for validation
- Ensures consistent validation across all environments
- Required for GitHub Actions and automated testing

#### üîÑ Keeping Config in Sync

When you add/remove artists from `.env`:

```bash
# Update the config file to match your .env
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py --update-config

# Commit the updated config
git add config/expected_artists.json
git commit -m "Update expected artists configuration"
```

### üö® Validation Failure Scenarios

#### Missing Artists
```
‚ùå Missing Artists (1):
   - New Artist Name

üí° Fix: Check .env configuration and run ETL to collect missing data
```

#### Unexpected Artists
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Unexpected Artists (1):
   - Unknown Channel

üí° Fix: Update config/expected_artists.json or clean database
```

#### Notebook Count Mismatch
```
‚ùå Music Analytics: Shows 5 artists, expected 6

üí° Fix: Run execute_music_analytics.py to regenerate with current data
```

## üîß Maintenance & Monitoring

### üìä Data Quality Checks
```bash
# Check data quality (should be run regularly)
python scripts/run_data_quality_checks.py

# Clean up unwanted channels
python tools/maintenance/cleanup_db.py --dry-run    # Preview
python tools/maintenance/cleanup_db.py --confirm    # Execute

# YouTube TOS compliance
python tools/maintenance/youtube_tos_compliance.py --status
```

### üìù Logs & Monitoring
```bash
# Check ETL pipeline logs
tail -f logs/nightly_pipeline.log

# Monitor data quality
tail -f logs/quality_monitoring.log

# Check TOS compliance
tail -f logs/tos_compliance.log
