- YouTube Data API v3 credentials
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended for large datasets

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd youtube-analytics-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Initialize environment
cp .env.example .env
# Configure .env with your credentials and artist channels

```

## Some things under the hood that keep this platform reliable

- **Operational health history**: Each CI run and scheduled job writes to the
  `operational_health_log` table. It tracks freshness, coverage, engagement, and
  reliability so you can review how the warehouse evolves. If the database is
  unreachable the insert fails, forcing real infrastructure to be ready before
  anyone claims success.
- **Strict CI expectations**: `make ci` executes formatting checks, duplicate
  detection, operational analytics, and notebook validation. The pipeline stops
  immediately when required environment variables or tables are missing—there are
  no synthetic fallbacks.
- **Notebook execution guarantees**: Storytelling notebooks must be run with live
  data prior to commit. The enhanced CI report highlights unexecuted cells so the
  review team knows every visualization reflects current metrics.

## About the creator

Hi, I'm **Wilton Moore**. I earned a Grammy nomination in 2021 for my work as an
audio engineer and have contributed to major label releases that demanded
meticulous engineering. I bring that same attention to detail into data science.
This project exists to help labels invest wisely while treating artists with the
respect their craft deserves. Every recommendation in this repository is framed
with empathy—these metrics represent people putting their lives into music, and
the analytics are here to elevate them, not reduce them to numbers.

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### 🎯 Analysis Types
Set `CHANNEL_ANALYSIS_TYPE` in `.env`:
- 🎵 `music_artists`: Focus on music artists (removes podcasts, business channels)
- 🎙️ `podcasts`: Optimize for podcast analytics
- 🎭 `mixed`: Analyze both music and podcast content
- 🌐 `general`: Any YouTube content without specific focus

### 🎨 Customize Artist Colors
Edit the `ARTIST_COLORS_JSON` in `.env`:
```json
{
  "Your Artist": "#1f77b4",     # 🔵 Blue
  "Another Artist": "#ff7f0e"   # 🟠 Orange
}
```

### ⚖️ YouTube TOS Compliance
Automatic compliance with YouTube's Terms of Service:
- Comments deleted after 30 days (configurable)
- Metrics retained for trend analysis (365 days)
- Automated cleanup runs daily at 4 AM

## 🎤 Channel Management & Configuration

### 📺 Adding Artist Channels to .env

The platform supports two types of YouTube channels for comprehensive music analytics:

#### 🎵 Main Artist Channels (User Content)
These are the artist's primary channels with vlogs, behind-the-scenes, and user-uploaded content:
```bash
# Format: YT_ARTISTNAME_YT=URL_or_Channel_ID
YT_BICFIZZLE_YT=https://youtube.com/@BicFizzle
YT_YOURARTIST_YT=https://www.youtube.com/@YourArtist
```

#### 🏷️ YouTube Topic Channels (Official Releases)
These auto-generated channels contain official music releases distributed through record labels:
```bash
# Format: YT_ARTISTNAME_TOPIC_YT=Channel_ID
YT_BICFIZZLE_TOPIC_YT=UC-9-kyTW8ZkZNDHQJ6FgpwQ
YT_YOURARTIST_TOPIC_YT=UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 💡 Pro Tips for Channel Configuration

#### ✅ Use Channel IDs Instead of URLs
**Recommended**: `YT_ARTIST_YT=UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
**Avoid**: `YT_ARTIST_YT=https://youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Why Channel IDs are better:**
- **Faster API calls**: Direct channel ID lookup vs URL resolution
- **More reliable**: URLs can change, Channel IDs are permanent
- **Better error handling**: Clearer error messages when channels don't exist
- **Reduced API quota usage**: Saves ~20% on YouTube API calls

#### 🔍 How to Find Channel IDs
1. **From Channel URL**: Visit channel → View Page Source → Search for `"channelId"`
2. **From Video URL**: Use any video → Channel ID is in the API response
3. **Browser Extension**: Install "YouTube Channel ID" extension
4. **API Tool**: Use YouTube's Channel List API with `forUsername` parameter

#### 🎯 Topic Channel Discovery
YouTube Topic channels are auto-generated for artists with official releases:
- **Format**: Usually starts with `UC` followed by 22 characters
- **Content**: Official music videos, albums, singles from distributors
- **Finding them**: Search "Artist Name - Topic" on YouTube
- **Verification**: Topic channels have a "🎵" icon and "Auto-generated by YouTube" text

### 🧹 Data Cleanup & Quality Control

#### ⚠️ Important: Raw Data Cleanup Required
If unwanted content gets into your database, you **must** clean it from ALL tables:

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS run dry-run first to see what will be deleted
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --dry-run

# 2. Review the output carefully, then confirm deletion
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 3. Verify cleanup was successful
python execute_data_quality.py
```

#### 🗄️ Tables That Need Cleanup
When removing unwanted channels, data must be deleted from:
- `youtube_videos_raw` (Raw API responses)
- `youtube_videos` (Processed video data)
- `youtube_metrics` (View counts, engagement data)
- `youtube_comments` (Comment data)
- `youtube_sentiment_summary` (Sentiment analysis results)

#### 🚨 Critical Cleanup Rules
1. **Never delete data manually** - Always use the cleanup scripts
2. **Always run --dry-run first** - Preview changes before executing
3. **Backup before major cleanups** - Use `mysqldump` for safety
4. **Check data quality after cleanup** - Run quality checks to verify results
5. **Update .env immediately** - Remove unwanted channels from configuration

### 🔧 Channel Management Commands

```bash
# View current channels in database
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --status

# Preview what would be cleaned (safe to run)
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --dry-run

# Execute cleanup (removes data permanently)
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# Check data quality after changes
python execute_data_quality.py

# Validate channel configuration
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py --validate-channels
```

### 🔍 Channel ID Finder Utility

Use the built-in utility to find Channel IDs easily:

```bash
# Find channel by @handle
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "@BicFizzle"

# Search for Topic channels
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "BiC Fizzle - Topic"

# Validate existing Channel ID
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "UC-9-kyTW8ZkZNDHQJ6FgpwQ"

# Search by artist name
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "Corook"
```

### 📊 Channel Performance Monitoring

After adding new channels, monitor their integration:

```bash
# Check if new channels are being processed
python execute_music_analytics.py | grep "Artists:"

# Verify data quality scores
python execute_data_quality.py | grep "OVERALL DATA QUALITY SCORE"

# Monitor for unexpected content
python tools/monitoring/sentiment_monitoring.py
```

### 🎯 Common Topic Channel Patterns

Most major artists have auto-generated Topic channels. Here are some examples:

| Artist Type | Main Channel Format | Topic Channel Format |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Independent Artist** | `@ArtistName` | `Artist Name - Topic` |
| **Label Artist** | `@ArtistName` | `Artist Name - Topic` |
| **Band/Group** | `@BandName` | `Band Name - Topic` |
| **Producer** | `@ProducerName` | `Producer Name - Topic` |

**Topic Channel Characteristics:**
- ✅ Auto-generated by YouTube when music is distributed
- ✅ Contains official releases from streaming platforms
- ✅ Usually has higher view counts for popular songs
- ✅ Includes music videos, audio tracks, and album releases
- ❌ No user-uploaded content (vlogs, behind-the-scenes)
- ❌ No custom thumbnails or channel art

## 🚨 Data Cleanup & Troubleshooting

### Common Cleanup Scenarios

#### 🗑️ Removing Unwanted Artists/Channels
If you accidentally added the wrong channel or want to remove an artist:

```bash
# 1. Remove from .env file first
# Edit .env and delete or comment out the unwanted YT_ARTIST_YT lines

# 2. Preview what will be deleted (ALWAYS run this first!)
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --dry-run

# 3. Review the output carefully - it shows exactly what will be deleted

# 4. If everything looks correct, execute the cleanup
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 5. Verify the cleanup worked
python execute_data_quality.py
```

#### 🔄 Replacing a Channel ID
If you need to update a channel ID (wrong channel, artist changed handles, etc.):

```bash
# 1. Update the channel ID in .env
# Change: YT_ARTIST_YT=old_channel_id
# To:     YT_ARTIST_YT=new_channel_id

# 2. Clean out old data
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 3. Run ETL to collect new data
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py

# 4. Verify new data is correct
python execute_music_analytics.py
```

#### 🧹 Full Database Reset
If you want to start completely fresh:

```bash
# 1. Backup your .env configuration
cp .env .env.backup

# 2. Clear all artist channels from .env temporarily
# Comment out all YT_*_YT lines

# 3. Run cleanup to remove all data
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm

# 4. Restore your .env and run ETL
cp .env.backup .env
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py
```

### 🚨 Critical Data Cleanup Rules

#### ⚠️ Before Any Cleanup Operation
1. **Backup your database**: `mysqldump yt_proj > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql`
2. **Review .env configuration**: Ensure only desired artists are listed
3. **Run dry-run first**: Always use `--dry-run` to preview changes
4. **Check data quality**: Run quality checks after cleanup

#### 🗄️ Tables Affected by Cleanup
When removing artists, data is deleted from ALL these tables:
- `youtube_videos_raw` - Raw API responses
- `youtube_videos` - Processed video metadata
- `youtube_metrics` - View counts and engagement data
- `youtube_comments` - Comment text and metadata
- `youtube_sentiment_summary` - Sentiment analysis results
- `youtube_etl_runs` - ETL execution logs

#### 🔍 Verification Commands
After any cleanup operation, run these to verify success:

```bash
# Check artist count matches .env configuration
python execute_music_analytics.py | head -10

# Verify data quality score (should be >95%)
python execute_data_quality.py | grep "OVERALL DATA QUALITY SCORE"

# Check for any unexpected channels
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --status

# Verify normalized tables are updated
ls -la music_analysis_tables/
```

### 🆘 Emergency Recovery

#### If Cleanup Deleted Too Much Data
```bash
# 1. Stop all ETL processes immediately
pkill -f "python.*etl"

# 2. Restore from backup (if you made one)
mysql yt_proj < backup_YYYYMMDD.sql

# 3. If no backup, re-run ETL (will take time to rebuild)
python tools/etl/run_focused_etl.py

# 4. Update .env to prevent future issues
# Review and fix channel configuration
```

#### If Wrong Artist Data Appears
```bash
# 1. Identify the problematic channel
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --status

# 2. Check .env for typos or wrong channel IDs
grep "YT_.*_YT" .env

# 3. Use channel finder to verify correct IDs
python tools/utilities/find_channel_id.py "@suspected_wrong_handle"

# 4. Fix .env and clean up
# Edit .env with correct channel ID
python tools/maintenance/comprehensive_data_cleanup.py --confirm
```

### 💡 Pro Tips for Clean Data

1. **Use Channel IDs, not URLs**: More reliable and faster
2. **Verify channels before adding**: Use the channel finder utility
3. **Start small**: Add one artist at a time to test
4. **Monitor data quality**: Run quality checks after each change
5. **Keep backups**: Database dumps before major changes
6. **Document changes**: Keep notes on why channels were added/removed

## 🚀 Quality Assurance & CI/CD

### 🔒 Pre-Commit Validation

Set up automatic quality checks that run before every commit:

```bash
# Install git hooks (one-time setup)
python scripts/setup_git_hooks.py

# Now every commit will automatically validate:
# ✅ Notebook syntax and structure
# ✅ Artist data consistency
# ✅ Import statements work
# ✅ Execute scripts run successfully
# ✅ All tests pass
```

### 🎤 Artist Data Validation

Ensure all configured artists appear in your data:

```bash
# Validate artist consistency
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py

# Update config from current .env (when adding/removing artists)
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py --update-config

# Validate only notebook outputs
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py --notebooks-only
```

### 🔧 Local CI/CD Pipeline

Run comprehensive quality checks before pushing:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
python scripts/run_local_ci.py

# Auto-fix issues where possible
python scripts/run_local_ci.py --fix-issues

# This validates:
# ✅ No duplicate notebooks
# ✅ Valid JSON syntax in all notebooks
# ✅ All imports work correctly
# ✅ Execute scripts have valid syntax
# ✅ Notebooks execute successfully
# ✅ Data consistency checks pass
# ✅ Artist data matches configuration
# ✅ All tests pass
```

### 📊 Artist Configuration Management

The system uses two sources for artist validation:

#### 🏠 Local Development (uses .env)
- Reads artist configuration from your `.env` file
- Automatically detects both main and Topic channels
- Perfect for local development and testing

#### 🏭 CI/CD Pipeline (uses config/expected_artists.json)
- Uses committed configuration file for validation
- Ensures consistent validation across all environments
- Required for GitHub Actions and automated testing

#### 🔄 Keeping Config in Sync

When you add/remove artists from `.env`:

```bash
# Update the config file to match your .env
python scripts/validate_artist_data.py --update-config

# Commit the updated config
git add config/expected_artists.json
git commit -m "Update expected artists configuration"
```

### 🚨 Validation Failure Scenarios

#### Missing Artists
```
❌ Missing Artists (1):
   - New Artist Name

💡 Fix: Check .env configuration and run ETL to collect missing data
```

#### Unexpected Artists
```
⚠️ Unexpected Artists (1):
   - Unknown Channel

💡 Fix: Update config/expected_artists.json or clean database
```

#### Notebook Count Mismatch
```
❌ Music Analytics: Shows 5 artists, expected 6

💡 Fix: Run execute_music_analytics.py to regenerate with current data
```

## 🔧 Maintenance & Monitoring

### 📊 Data Quality Checks
```bash
# Check data quality (should be run regularly)
python scripts/run_data_quality_checks.py

# Clean up unwanted channels
python tools/maintenance/cleanup_db.py --dry-run    # Preview
