# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current notebook system produces scaffold code instead of proper storytelling notebooks that follow the established steering guidelines. Users expect notebooks that tell compelling stories about music industry data, with human narratives, educational content, and actionable insights. The current artist comparison notebook is broken and needs to be rebuilt to match the quality standards set by other executed documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music industry analyst, I want executed notebooks that tell compelling stories about artist performance, so that I can understand the data in context and make informed investment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notebook is executed THEN it SHALL contain actual data analysis with real results, not scaffold code
2. WHEN viewing an executed notebook THEN it SHALL follow a clear narrative flow from introduction to conclusion
3. WHEN reading the analysis THEN it SHALL include human-readable explanations that connect data to music industry concepts
4. WHEN examining charts THEN they SHALL be beautiful, emotional, and interactive (Plotly/Altair) with consistent artist color schemes from .env configuration
5. IF an artist shows momentum THEN the notebook SHALL explain what this means for their career trajectory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data science student learning about the music industry, I want notebooks that explain complex concepts in accessible language, so that I can understand both the technical analysis and business implications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering technical concepts THEN the notebook SHALL provide educational explanations suitable for students
2. WHEN showing statistical analysis THEN it SHALL explain what the numbers mean in music business terms
3. WHEN presenting recommendations THEN it SHALL justify decisions with clear reasoning
4. WHEN displaying charts THEN it SHALL include context about what patterns indicate for artist careers
5. IF using industry terminology THEN it SHALL define terms for readers new to music business

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a label executive, I want artist comparison analysis that provides actionable investment recommendations, so that I can allocate marketing budget effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing artists THEN the notebook SHALL rank performance across multiple metrics
2. WHEN showing growth trends THEN it SHALL identify which artists deserve increased investment
3. WHEN analyzing engagement THEN it SHALL highlight standout performers and explain why

5. IF recommending budget allocation THEN it SHALL provide specific next steps and expected ROI

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want notebooks that execute reliably and produce consistent results, so that I can trust the analysis for business decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a notebook THEN it SHALL load real data from the database successfully
2. WHEN generating charts THEN they SHALL render properly with all data points visible
3. WHEN calculating metrics THEN results SHALL be accurate and validated
4. WHEN saving executed notebooks THEN they SHALL contain complete analysis with outputs
5. IF data is missing THEN the notebook SHALL handle gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want notebooks that show compassion for artists' journeys, so that the analysis respects the human element behind the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN discussing artist performance THEN the language SHALL be respectful and encouraging
2. WHEN showing declining metrics THEN it SHALL focus on opportunities rather than failures
3. WHEN highlighting success THEN it SHALL celebrate achievements while remaining professional
4. WHEN making comparisons THEN it SHALL avoid harsh judgments about artistic merit
5. IF an artist is struggling THEN recommendations SHALL focus on constructive support strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a professor reviewing student work, I want notebooks that are easy to follow without jumping between cells, so that I can understand the analysis flow and evaluate the work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading a notebook THEN each cell SHALL be self-contained with clear purpose and output
2. WHEN viewing executed results THEN it SHALL be obvious which code produced which output
3. WHEN following the analysis THEN the narrative SHALL flow logically without requiring cell jumping
4. WHEN examining charts THEN the markdown above SHALL explain what to look for in the visualization
5. IF code is complex THEN the markdown SHALL explain the approach before showing results

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who values aesthetics, I want notebooks with fun, engaging markdown and beautiful visualizations, so that the analysis is enjoyable to read and share.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading markdown cells THEN they SHALL use engaging, fun language that makes data exciting
