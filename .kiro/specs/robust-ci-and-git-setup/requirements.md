# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a simple but professional CI system that helps a new developer validate their YouTube analytics platform before uploading to GitHub. The focus is on building confidence, catching obvious mistakes, and creating a portfolio piece that demonstrates good development practices without overwhelming complexity.

7. WHEN CI passes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive validation reports for AI agents to analyze system health

### Requirement 2: Fix My Git Setup

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want to figure out why my commits aren't showing up on GitHub and get my repository properly connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check my git setup THEN the system SHALL tell me where my commits have been going
2. WHEN I connect to GitHub THEN my existing commits SHALL still be preserved
3. WHEN I push to GitHub THEN I SHALL see my commits appear in my online repository
4. WHEN setting up GitHub THEN the system SHALL walk me through it step-by-step
5. IF I don't have a GitHub repository yet THEN the system SHALL help me create one

### Requirement 3: Make My Repository Look Professional

**User Story:** As a new developer building my portfolio, I want my GitHub repository to look impressive and be easy for others to understand and use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN someone visits my repository THEN they SHALL immediately understand what it does and why it's cool
2. WHEN someone wants to try my project THEN they SHALL have clear setup instructions that actually work
3. WHEN potential employers look at my code THEN they SHALL see good practices like tests and documentation
4. WHEN other developers want to contribute THEN they SHALL know how to get started
5. IF someone forks my repository THEN they SHALL be able to run it with their own data

### Requirement 4: Help AI Agents Understand My System

**User Story:** As a developer working with AI agents, I want the CI system to check that my notebooks and database are working properly so the AI can give me better help.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my notebooks run THEN the system SHALL check that they produce reasonable outputs
2. WHEN checking my database THEN the system SHALL verify the data looks correct
3. WHEN an AI agent helps me THEN it SHALL have access to information about what's working and what's broken
4. WHEN something is wrong THEN the system SHALL give me specific suggestions on how to fix it
5. IF my data looks weird THEN the system SHALL warn me before I upload broken stuff to GitHub

### Requirement 5: Strategic Repository Architecture for Senior Portfolio

**User Story:** As a data developer building a senior-level portfolio, I want a strategic approach to repository organization that showcases both focused tools and comprehensive solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for public release THEN the system SHALL identify high-impact tools that demonstrate advanced data engineering capabilities
2. WHEN organizing repositories THEN the system SHALL create both focused single-purpose tools and comprehensive platform demonstrations
3. WHEN someone evaluates my work THEN they SHALL see evidence of production-grade practices including monitoring, observability, and operational excellence
4. WHEN potential employers review my code THEN they SHALL find examples of complex data pipeline architecture, real-time processing, and scalable design patterns
5. IF someone wants to extend my work THEN they SHALL find well-documented APIs, extensible architecture, and comprehensive test coverage

### Requirement 6: Advanced Data Engineering Showcase

**User Story:** As a senior data developer, I want my repository to demonstrate advanced capabilities that distinguish me from junior developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing my codebase THEN evaluators SHALL see evidence of advanced SQL optimization, complex ETL patterns, and data quality frameworks
2. WHEN examining my analytics THEN they SHALL find sophisticated statistical analysis, machine learning integration, and business intelligence insights
3. WHEN exploring my architecture THEN they SHALL discover scalable design patterns, proper separation of concerns, and enterprise-grade error handling
4. WHEN assessing my operational practices THEN they SHALL find comprehensive monitoring, alerting, performance optimization, and disaster recovery planning
5. IF someone needs to scale my solution THEN they SHALL find clear documentation on performance characteristics, bottlenecks, and scaling strategies

### Requirement 7: Production-Ready Deployment and Operations

**User Story:** As a data developer targeting senior roles, I want to demonstrate operational excellence and production deployment capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL include comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities
2. WHEN operating in production THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics on data quality, pipeline performance, and system health
3. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide automated diagnostics, rollback capabilities, and incident response procedures
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate horizontal scaling patterns and resource optimization strategies
5. IF compliance is required THEN the system SHALL include audit trails, data lineage tracking, and privacy protection mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Senior-Level Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a data developer demonstrating senior-level capabilities, I want my codebase to exemplify professional development practices with clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any code file THEN it SHALL be extensively commented explaining complex logic, business context, and potential pitfalls
2. WHEN examining database operations THEN all SQL queries SHALL be human-readable with proper formatting, line breaks, and clear variable naming
3. WHEN assessing code complexity THEN functions SHALL maintain recommended LOC limits and follow single responsibility principle
4. WHEN evaluating code quality THEN there SHALL be NO bulky AI-generated code that appears amateurish or unnecessarily verbose
5. WHEN running the CI system THEN ALL tests SHALL pass without exception before any git operations are permitted
6. IF any changes are made to the codebase THEN TDD practices SHALL be followed with tests written before implementation

### Requirement 9: Git Safety and Rollback Strategy

**User Story:** As a data developer working on a critical portfolio piece, I want proper git safety measures and rollback points to protect my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining the final repository structure THEN the system SHALL create an immediate commit as a rollback point
2. WHEN making significant changes THEN the system SHALL ensure all tests pass before allowing commits
3. WHEN preparing for public release THEN the system SHALL validate that no sensitive data or credentials are included
4. WHEN organizing the repository THEN the system SHALL maintain clean commit history with meaningful commit messages
5. IF issues are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback procedures to previous stable states
